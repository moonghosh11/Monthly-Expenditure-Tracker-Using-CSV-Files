# Problem Statement

Managing personal finances is essential for financial stability, yet most people struggle to track where their money goes every month. Traditional methods like notebooks or manual calculations are time-consuming, error-prone, and offer little insight into spending patterns.

The problem addressed in this project is the lack of a simple, accessible, and lightweight tool that allows users to:

Log daily expenses

Organize expenses by category

Calculate monthly totals

Analyze spending habits


This project provides a beginner-friendly, Python-based solution using CSV files for data storage — eliminating the need for a full database.
